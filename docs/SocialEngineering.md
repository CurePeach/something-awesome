# Social Engineering

The social engineering level tests the user's ability to misdirect others and abuse their cognitive biases. 

There will be a meter that starts at a certain percentage in the level. This meter measures their focus. If the meter hits zero, the game ends. If the meter hits one hundred, the game will proceed to the next part. To advance the meter, there will be a series of actions or dialogues you can choose, and they will either add or subtract points. 

## The Little Mermaid

In the Little Mermaid, the sea witch convinces the mermaid to give her voice for a pair of legs. This is spear-phishing, convincing someone to give something of great value (often it is credit card details) for basically free.

## Snow White

The story of Snow White preys on the kindness of human beings. We have a cognitive bias towards old people especially old women and it is frowned upon to be rude to them.
