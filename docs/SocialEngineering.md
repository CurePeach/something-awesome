# Social Engineering

The social engineering level tests the user's ability to misdirect others and abuse their cognitive biases. 

There will be a meter that starts at a certain percentage in the level. This meter measures their focus. If the meter hits zero, the game ends. If the meter hits one hundred, the game will proceed to the next part. To advance the meter, there will be a series of actions or dialogues you can choose, and they will either add or subtract points. 

## What Began the Trojan War

It is believed the Greek gods were the ones that catalysed the Trojan war, and what it took was a little social engineering. Similar to the story of Sleeping Beauty, it all started with a "gift" from an unwanted guest. This time the unwanted guest was Eris, the goddess of discord, and her gift was a golden apple with the inscription "To the fairest". Three goddesses, Athena, Hera and Aphrodite, wanted that apple. Eris being the goddess of discord really knew how to reign chaos with little to no effort on her part. The other gods were afraid to choose so they employed a human to do so. This human was Paris of Troy, and he couldn't choose either, so instead each goddess resorted to bribes. Athena offered him wisdom, skill in battle and the abilities of all the greatest warriors, Hera offered him political power and control of all of Asia and Aphrodite offered him the love of the most beautiful mortal woman in the world. Aphrodite employed her own social engineering here preying on the his deepest desire. Since the most beautiful woman (Helen of Sparta) was already married, this sparked the Trojan War.

**Recommendations for the attacker**:

The attackers in this story are Eris and Aphrodite who employ social engineering successfully on the three goddesses and Paris respectively.

**Recommendations for the defender**:

The defenders in this story are the victims of the attackers - Athena, Hera and Aphrodite, and Paris.

What could Athena, Hera and Aphrodite have done to not be prey of Eris' social engineering?

- They could have gone against Zeus' order for excluding Eris in particular. There are much worse gods to have at parties than Eris and yet she was the only one excluded. If Eris had no motive to cause discord, this would solve a lot of problems. I've read somewhere that the gods aren't meant to be humans but really exaggerated humans with dangerous amounts of power. This incident really supports that theory because it is common for humans to avoid a situation by pushing it away rather than fix it properly.
- The gods aren't meant to be able to learn from their mistakes. That's why Zeus impregnates every second woman in Ancient Greece... but if the gods could learn from their mistakes, that would solve a lot of problems. It is too common of a situation for the gods to be tricked into humiliation through the same method over and over again. Athena turned Ariadne into a spider for being better than her at weaving. Hera curses half the women Zeus impregnates even though it is Zeus who deserves the punishment. Aphrodite has a fragile ego and can't imagine anyone being more beautiful than her to the point she tortured her own son's wife, Psyche.
- The most practical solution would be to investigate the apple. Who did it come from? Where did it come from? Is it even safe to eat? Surely the person who gifted the apple would tell them who the apple was intended for. This would lead them back to Eris who they know creates discord. Since every god has an insanely large ego, if they knew Eris was the one who gave the apple, they would ignore it, reluctant to give in to her discord.

What could Paris have done to not be prey of Aphrodite's social engineering?

- Aphrodite's gift in my opinion was a big scam. I doubt in Paris' wildest imaginations, he would be in the middle of a war between nations. Whenever anyone is approached with something that even remotely smells like a scam, they should ask for the details and compare with everything else in the market. If Paris asked for what would happen when he accepted each gift, would his decision have changed?
