# Security Through Obscurity

The security through obscurity level will test the player's ability to navigate clues and formulate them into an answer. 

There will be different clickable objects in the scene, and the player can only choose three to click on. Then, from there, they will have to type the answer into the input dialog that will appear.

## Sleeping Beauty (Disney version)

In the story of Sleeping Beauty, the main secret was the curse placed on the princess by the evil fairy and this was kept hidden from the princess by making her only company the three good fairies who promised to never tell her. This curse was that when she would turn 16, she would prick her finger on the spindle of the spinning wheel and fall into an eternal sleep which could only be broken with true love's kiss. The parents of the princess gave their child away to the good fairies and let them raise her in hopes of avoiding the curse.

**Recommendations for the attacker**:

In fairytales, fate is everything so there was no doubt in the story that the princess would eventually fall asleep and be woken but let's discount that. Let's say the evil fairy could abuse this situation.

- The evil fairy was a powerful fairy and could've tried to best them in combat. Since they were hidden in secret away from the rest of the world, it was only the evil fairy versus the good fairies. There was no way backup could be sent and she also had the element of surprise on her side. There is, however, the requirement of finding the good fairies' secret hideout.
- The evil fairy could have cursed the regular people of the kingdom leading to lots and lots of death so no one would have been left to save the princess. Since the princess was being kept hidden and the good fairies were taking care of her, they would have no idea what would be going on in the outside world. If the princess happened to escape and explore like she did in the movie, she might have also been accidentally killed which is what the evil fairy ultimately wants.
- Similar to the story of Snow White, the evil fairy could dress up as a stranger and coax the princess into the curse. Since the princess has had no contact with strangers and has no idea of any of the possible dangers to her life because of the curse, this is a relatively easy strategy to abuse her lack of knowledge. Similar to the first recommendation, she would have to find the hideout first.

**Recommendations for the defender**:

There are multiple defenders in this situation - the parents and the good fairies.

The parents' strategy to defending from the curse was 1) burning all the spindles so there were no spindles to fit the curse and 2) hiding the princess away from the evil fairy so she couldn't pull any more nasty tricks. By hiding the princess, they have bought themselves time to act and take initiative. Instead of sitting around waiting for the princess to come back, what could they have done?

- They could've gone hunting for the evil fairy. Maybe killing the evil fairy would have automatically lifted the curse because the magic is innately tied with the one who wields it. It wouldn't hurt to try. 
- They could've negotiated with the evil fairy. What would she want in return for their daughter's life? The parents were royalty so they could've offered her fame and riches.

The good fairies could have done better as caretakers.

- They were the ones who asked to take the cursed princess away from her parents to protect her. However, they fed her lies by hiding their true identities and hers. As she was growing up, it would have been fair game to tell her why she was hidden away. Once the secret comes out, she would have lost her trust in the good fairies and gotten herself into trouble much faster. By trusting the princess with the information, they would have equipped her to defend herself.
- Their use of magic towards the princess' 16th birthday was what led the evil fairy to find them so they could've held on for a little bit longer and the situation would have been safer. Instead of letting the princess roam the forest, they could've asked her to help them and so, they wouldn't be able to use magic because they were pretending to be peasants.

This final recommendation is to not use security through obscurity at all.

- Instead of sending their child away, they could have educated her instead of kept things secret from her. A good education leads to good decision making which leads to a responsible princess who can take care of herself. I also believe it was unfair of her parents to take her away from her life.

## The Love Story of Eros and Psyche

Psyche was a beautiful and kind princess who was loved by all but from afar. Many people would come and admire her beauty but they wouldn't befriend her. Somewhere along the line, they began treating her like the Goddess of Love and Beauty by giving her offerings and praying to her. This made Aphrodite mad so she sent her son Eros after Psyche to punish her for trying to usurp Aphrodite. Instead, Eros fell in love with her, protected her from Aphrodite and eventually married her. 

When Eros married Psyche, she received a mansion for a home, invisible servants and protection from Aphrodite. Every night, Eros would come home and they would sleep together but she was never allowed to know who he was. 

**Recommendations for the attacker**:

In the myth, Psyche had two sisters who were extremely jealous of her marriage. Psyche invited them over because she trusted them and they decided they would sabotage her because they never liked her anyway because of her beauty, and now her marriage. They had both ended up miserable with husbands they didn't like so they wanted Psyche's life.

- In the myth, they manipulated Psyche to look at his face while sleeping. They abused the secret because it left a gap in Psyche's trust in Eros. They began putting thoughts into Psyche's head saying that he's probably a monster so if she saw him, she would leave him. They framed it as they were worried about her and that's why she should take their advice. This ends up getting Psyche to betray Eros. Since her sisters don't have any tangible involvement, it gave the sisters hope they would have a chance with Psyche's husband.
- Psyche really loved her sisters until they betrayed her so I think they could've abused this trust more. If they asked Psyche to stay with her overnight in order to protect her from the husband she had never seen before, they could've sabotaged the relationship here to make Psyche miserable. However, in this situation, they would still be miserable because Eros would never go to them since they ruined his relationship.
- Another point of attack would be to guilt Psyche into giving up her life. This is a plausible approach because what did Psyche have to lose? She didn't even know what Eros looked like. The sisters were cruel and miserable. They would do anything to get a good life and they believed they deserved the riches at the house Psyche lived in. Psyche was kind-hearted and would probably do it and if not, she would give them a decent amount of the riches she had.

Another attacker would be Aphrodite who wanted to get vengance on Psyche for stealing her position as the Goddess of Love and Beauty. 

- She could've interrogated Eros and asked for the details of Psyche's life with the punishment. This would lead to Eros creating a web of lies and Aphrodite would be able to tear it apart bit by bit to find the secret he's hiding.
- Aphrodite could've asked to watch Eros punish Psyche. This would have made it more difficult for Eros to protect Psyche and if he didn't love her enough, the punishment would have been completed and none of this story would have happened.

**Recommendations for the defender**:

In this story, Eros is truly the only defender. This is because he wants to keep the secret and keep his marriage and love secure.

- If everything disappears when she looked at him, couldn't Eros have just offered himself through the other four senses to Psyche? Eros could have said, "Put on this blindfold" and let her touch his face so she knew he wasn't a monster. This removes the secret and it means the fact that Psyche doesn't know can't be manipulated against her.
- He could have also proposed to her normally without the can't see what I look like thing. He could have told Aphrodite, "Psyche won't be bothering you anymore because she is in love with the most horrid thing in the world (me), and is the Goddess of the Human Soul (which is not as beautiful as you, Mother)." This means she knows that he's a god, Aphrodite doesn't care anymore and the world moves on.
- Eros should have built trust with Psyche. He should have spent time with her and spoke with her. Psyche had never had any friends beforehand because she was extremely pretty and people were either jealous or afraid of her. If he built trust with her, she never would have betrayed his secret.
