# Security through Obscurity

The security through obscurity level will test the player's ability to navigate clues and formulate them into an answer. 

There will be different clickable objects in the scene, and the player can only choose three to click on. Then, from there, they will have to type the answer into the input dialog that will appear.

## Sleeping Beauty (Disney version)

In the story of Sleeping Beauty, the main secret was the curse placed on the princess by the evil fairy and this was kept hidden from the princess by making her only company the three good fairies who promised to never tell her. This curse was that when she would turn 16, she would prick her finger on the spindle of the spinning wheel and fall into an eternal sleep which could only be broken with true love's kiss. The parents of the princess gave their child away to the good fairies and let them raise her in hopes of avoiding the curse.

**Recommendations for the attacker**:

In fairytales, fate is everything so there was no doubt in the story that the princess would eventually fall asleep and be woken but let's discount that. Let's say the evil fairy could abuse this situation.

- She has magic so she could have used it to somehow locate either the good fairies or the princess. However, three fairies probably overpowers one so this might not have been feasible.
- The evil fairy could have cursed the regular people of the kingdom leading to lots and lots of death so no one would have been left to save the princess. Since the princess was being kept hidden and the good fairies were taking care of her, they would have no idea what would be going on in the outside world. If the princess happened to escape and explore like she did in the movie, she might have also been accidentally killed which is what the evil fairy ultimately wants.
- Similar to the story of Snow White, the evil fairy could dress up as a stranger and coax the princess into the curse. Since the princess has had no contact with strangers and has no idea of any of the possible dangers to her life because of the curse, this is a relatively easy strategy to abuse her lack of knowledge. There is, however, the requirement of finding the good fairies' secret hideout.

**Recommendations for the defender**:

There are multiple defenders in this situation - the parents and the good fairies.

The parents' strategy to defending from the curse was 1) burning all the spindles so there were no spindles to fit the curse and 2) hiding the princess away from the evil fairy so she couldn't pull any more nasty tricks. What else could they have done?

- They could've gone hunting for the evil fairy. Maybe killing the evil fairy would have automatically lifted the curse because the magic is innately tied with the one who wields it. It wouldn't hurt to try.
- They could've negotiated with the evil fairy. What would she want in return for their daughter's life? The parents were royalty so they could've offered her fame and riches.
- Instead of sending their child away, they could have educated her instead of kept things secret from her. A good education leads to good decision making which leads to a responsible princess who can take care of herself. I also believe it was unfair of her parents to take her away from her life.

The good fairies could have done better as caretakers.

- They were the ones who asked to take the cursed princess away from her parents to protect her. However, they fed her lies by hiding their true identities and hers. As she was growing up, it would have been fair game to tell her why she was hidden away. Once the secret comes out, she would have lost her trust in the good fairies and gotten herself into trouble much faster. By trusting the princess with the information, they would have equipped her to defend herself.
- Their use of magic towards the princess' 16th birthday was what led the evil fairy to find them so they could've held on for a little bit longer and the situation would have been safer. Instead of letting the princess roam the forest, they could've asked her to help them and so, they wouldn't be able to use magic because they were pretending to be peasants.
