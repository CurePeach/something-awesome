## Cinderella

This will serve as a tutorial.

When the prince is searching across the kingdom for Cinderella, his only way of finding her is the glass slipper she left behind. However, that is also how he is filtering through the girls of the kingdom. He lets them try on the shoe and if it fits, he will marry them and if it doesn't, he will keep looking.

This isn't very secure because someone could have just destroyed the shoe and he would be left nothing.

**Recommendations**:

- Make copies of the shoe so the information isn't lost if the shoe is broken.

- Find the other shoe. Shoes come in pairs.

- Hold another ball.
