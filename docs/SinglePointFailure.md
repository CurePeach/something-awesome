# Single Point of Failure

The single point of failure level will test the user's ability to evaluate a situation and spot the single point of failure. 

The level will have a numerous amount of clickable objects. When one object is clicked, an attempt will be spent, and each player only has five attempts across the entire series of different situations. 

## Cinderella (Grimm version)

The story of Cinderella is about a kind girl who is bullied by her family. She is forced to work menial chores and is not allowed to have any luxuries or leisure. To save her from the life of a slave, her kindness is rewarded through a magic hazel tree and white doves which grant her any wish. Since she is so kind, she always returns the gifts the tree gave her such as the dresses and slippers she wears to the prince's ball. One day, she leaves a slipper behind and this is the prince's only clue to find her.

**Recommendations for the attacker**:

Her family want to keep Cinderella as a slave for their own benefit but also because they are rotten and cruel. They are the attackers in the story but they can approach this from two angles.

1. They want to ruin Cinderella's life, and don't care much about the prince.

- The prince searches for her by using a shoe. Even if they didn't know it was Cinderella who owned the shoe, they could have destroyed it so no one could have the prince, and on the off chance it was Cinderella, that would be great. They would have broken her hopes even more.
- They could have locked her up so there was no way that she could try on the shoe. The single point of failure in the turning point of her life is her trying on the shoe. Her family can attack the shoe or they can attack her. By locking her up and pretending she doesn't exist, there is no way for her to escape. Especially because her wishes only work when she is under the tree.

2. They want the prince all to themselves. It's a bonus if they make Cinderella unhappy.

- In the story, the two stepsisters of Cinderella actually chop their toes and heel respectively to fit the shoe. However, the birds that Cinderella had befriended warned the prince of the blood in the shoe. This could've been avoided by just wrapping their feet in bandages. When the prince asks why their feet are wrapped, they could reply with "My feet were sore from dancing with you yesterday."
- They could become a better person and make him fall in love with them instead. Show him around the estate, bake him some bread and just court him. There are extra points because Cinderella will watch you from her window and he'll never know the girl he danced with is right under his nose.

However, if they were much more persistent earlier, they could have attacked the true single point of failure to this entire story - Cinderella's kindness. If Cinderella wasn't kind, she wouldn't have had a magic tree that granted her wishes, birds that treated her as their friend, a prince that fell in love with her and the list goes on. Alas, they are too late at this point of the story.

**Recommendations for the defender**:

The defenders in this story are Cinderella and the prince. Cinderella throughout the entire story was defending herself from her family's cruelty and I personally think she did really well in the fairytale. The prince, on the other hand, needs some recommendations.

- He got duped by the stepsisters cutting their feet. He should really be inspecting these ladies properly.
- In the Grimm's version of Cinderella, the prince danced with Cinderella three balls in a row, and took her home. He even dropped her off at her home. He was really stupid to not ask her name during the second or the third ball. The prince could have easily learnt more about Cinderella by just sitting down and speaking to her. He would then be able to identify her voice, share secrets so he could authenticate her in the future and know her details like her name, her birthday and her everyday life. 
    - Since Cinderella is ultimately a kind person, she wouldn't lie but there is also the chance she wouldn't say anything at all.
    - Would the prince still like her if he found out she was a maid? I believe he didn't care Cinderella was a maid at the end because he knew how horrid Cinderella's family was. What if he didn't know? There's a good chance he'll just leave her be.
- Instead of visiting Cinderella's estate and using the shoe as his way of finding her, why didn't he use his own instincts? He had danced with her multiple times for many hours and would know her very well. He could have visited asked for a tour of the estate because the girl he loved lived there. This would be a way to coax Cinderella out and lower the defences of her cruel family. This gives hope to the stepsisters that maybe they're the girl he loves!
