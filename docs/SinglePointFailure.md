# Single Point of Failure

## Cinderella

When the prince is searching across the kingdom for Cinderella, his only way of finding her is the glass slipper she left behind. However, that is also how he is filtering through the girls of the kingdom. He lets them try on the shoe and if it fits, he will marry them and if it doesn't, he will keep looking.

**Recommendations for the attacker**:

- Break the shoe.

- Swap the shoe when he isn't looking.

- Attack the prince. You can threaten or blackmail him because he is coming to everyone's houses.

- Become a better person so he will pick you instead. Instead of trying on the shoe, show him around town.

**Recommendations for the defender**:

- Make copies of the shoe so the information isn't lost if the shoe is broken.

- Find the other shoe. Shoes come in pairs.

- Hold another ball.
