# Something Awesome progress

During the first week's lectures, I realised security is everywhere and when I mean everywhere, I mean in everything we consume. From social media to public transport to our own hobbies. My hobbies are playing video games and reading fiction books, so what do we get when we combine those with a dash of security?

*A game with puzzles inspired by security from fiction.*

I'm currently researching which frameworks would be suitable for the project to take the bulk of this project away from learning how to code video games and more about how to showcase examples of security from my favourite stories... which would be awesome. :)
