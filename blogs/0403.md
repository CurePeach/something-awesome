# Something Awesome sprint 1 complete!

After revising and finalising my documents and code regarding Security through Obscurity, I think I've finished most of what I intended to and the last thing that needs refining are the clues and the question. Right now, the question and clues that I have are mediocre. I haven't really figured out what a good question would be that has a singular answer that clues could point to.

My ultimate reflection after the sprint was that I may have shot a bit too far with the project specification. Originally, I wanted to do three levels with two parts each. What I have accomplished so far is one level with one part. I'm still trying to figure out how I can use the same code with different clues, questions and pictures... I'll figure it out eventually. I also think ideating the levels is also kind of hard so we'll see how much I get completed at the end.
